This directory contains the 24x14 - QuaDRiGa 5G channel realizations used in our work "Physics Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels".
The procedure how the channel realizations are generated is explained in Appendix D.2 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=FFJFT93oa7).

The datasets are

ofdm5grural_12000.npy (12000 channel realizations in the rural environment, see paper)
ofdm5gurban_12000.npy (12000 channel realizations in the urban environment, see paper)
