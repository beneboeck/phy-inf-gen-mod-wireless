This directory contains the 3GPP data used in our work "Physics Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels".
The procedure how the channel realizations are generated is explained in Appendix D.1 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=FFJFT93oa7).

The file names are structured as 

h#(number of antennas)_#(number of paths)paths_#(number of data samples)
